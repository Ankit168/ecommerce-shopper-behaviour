E-commerce Customer Behavior Analysis Project
The main objective was to understand the factors that influence customer behavior and predict whether a user will make a purchase or not, based on other attributes of the users.

Data
The data used for this project was collected by the e-commerce client over a year, with each row representing a different user. The dataset contains various attributes, including user demographics, browsing history, and purchase behavior. The target variable is the "Made_purchase" column, which indicates whether the user has made a purchase or not during the year.

The data was collected by non-experts, so it might have some percentage of error in some columns. As a result, a data cleaning process was carried out to remove duplicates, correct errors, and impute missing values where necessary.

Analysis
The project involved various data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict the "Made_purchase" column using other attributes of the users. The process included data visualization, feature engineering, and predictive modeling. A range of algorithms, such as logistic regression and decision trees, were used to analyze the data and create accurate predictions.

Results
The project successfully delivered actionable insights to the e-commerce client regarding customer behavior and helped predict whether a user will make a purchase or not. The project also demonstrated the expertise in data analysis and machine learning, as well as attention to detail when it comes to data cleaning and preprocessing.
